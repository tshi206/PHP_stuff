 * mysqli_real_escape_string() only escapes the string you send to the database, where as prepared statements
 *  works differently by sending the query to the database before sending the actual data. This means that we
 *  don't need to escape the string we send, because the data isn't send together with a new query. Therefore
 *  mysqli_real_escape_string() is obsolete. And because we send the query before the data, it makes it more
 * secure since the user doesn't get the chance to "mess" with our query.ï»¿
 * In fact, the parameters in the prepared statements are sent via different protocols and only treated as plain
 * characters, hence SQL injection is prevented.
